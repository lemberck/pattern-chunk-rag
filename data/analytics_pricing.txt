Pricing experiments around $19 vs $24 moved conversion less than onboarding friction did.
Regionally, price sensitivity exists, but the largest swings map to verification timing in step 2.
LTV projections remained stable even when the cheaper tier won the short-term test in two countries.

When we segment by network type, mobile data users are most impacted by SMS latency.
Email as a fallback neutralizes the gap, suggesting channel reliability outweighs nominal price differences.
The model attributes 70% of recent variance to verification changes rather than pricing.

Given the above, we recommend pausing new price tests until verification reliability stabilizes.
Our next analysis will focus on carrier-level latency curves and their impact on activation cohorts.
We'll revisit pricing once the funnel baseline stops oscillating.
