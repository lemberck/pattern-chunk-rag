Incident 2025-07-14: unexpected throttling across regions during a seasonal campaign.
Root cause: a billing misconfiguration set the account to a lower plan, reducing rate limits without a corresponding alert.
Impact: ingestion delays, dashboard staleness, and partner timeouts for roughly 47 minutes.

Contributing factors included a missing deploy check for billing tier, and dashboards that hid rate-limit headroom behind another tab.
Mitigations: CI policy now blocks tier changes without an approval token, and observability shows headroom prominently.
We also tuned client retry logic to respect headers and avoid lockstep retries that amplify contention.

Follow-ups: simulate quota shocks weekly, validate partner behavior under tight budgets, and explore autoscaling proxies.
We expect these to cut mean time to recovery by at least 30% in similar incidents.
