Release 2.8 updates step 2 copy, adds a live "code received" indicator, and clarifies when to request a new code.
The field label now explains why verification protects the account, and the help icon links to a short explainer.
We also animated the resend button to show a cool-down period instead of silently disabling it.

Accessibility reviewed the changes: labels meet contrast ratios and focus order is predictable.
Screen readers announce the code countdown, the success state, and errors with specific recovery suggestions.
We included telemetry for code arrival times and resend usage to compare carriers by region.

Minor fixes shipped alongside: tooltip alignment, padding on small screens, and consistent status colors.
If metrics confirm lower abandonment, we will roll the pattern into desktop and tablet flows.
Rollback is staged if we detect regressions in activation in the first 24 hours.
