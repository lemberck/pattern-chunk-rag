We observed a surge of 429 responses after the billing tier was downgraded in the staging-to-prod handoff.
Lower plan tiers enforce stricter rate limits, which throttled bulk ingestion and downstream metrics pipelines.
Backoff logic softened the spike, but throughput recovered only after restoring the higher tier and rebalancing queues.

Logs show clear temporal alignment: the downgrade at 11:04 UTC, the first 429 burst at 11:05, and saturation by 11:10.
Alerting fired on error rate but not on quota headroom; we need a proactive gauge for remaining requests per window.
Client SDKs with adaptive jitter performed better than fixed backoff, especially during concurrent spikes.

Action items include a CI guard that locks billing tier on deploy, and synthetic probes that exercise quota edges.
We also plan to publish a runbook on interpreting rate-limit headers to guide partners through retries.
A dashboard will chart regional headroom to catch early signs of throttling.
