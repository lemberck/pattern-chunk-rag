Several customers cited verification delays during sign-up; two minutes felt "like forever" on mobile data.
Some admitted abandoning because the screen offered no hint about alternatives or typical wait times.
A minority disliked sharing a phone number at all and wanted to defer verification until they trusted the product more.

Others praised email verification as more reliable in their region, while a few asked for WhatsApp for convenience.
One customer suggested surfacing a code input even before the SMS arrives, so they can type as they receive it.
Another asked for a visible clock to know whether to request a new code or keep waiting.

Themes recurred across interviews: friction at step 2, low feedback, and missing fallback paths.
Addressing these concerns could reduce abandonment without sacrificing security.
We should test a design that pairs immediate value with a gentle, well-explained verification.
