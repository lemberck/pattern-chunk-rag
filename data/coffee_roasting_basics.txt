Light roasts preserve acidity and origin character, while darker roasts emphasize bittersweet caramel notes and smoke.
Beans lose mass during roasting as moisture escapes, and oils migrate toward the surface as temperatures rise.
Crack stages mark structural changes: first crack expands cells; second crack risks tipping toward carbonization.

Cooling quickly stops the roast; slow or uneven cooling can bake flavors and mute aromatics.
Agitation during cooling prevents scorching, while airflow balances temperature drop and chaff removal.
Profiles that stretch development time bring out chocolate notes, but too long turns cups flat.

Grind size and freshness drive extraction more than most equipment upgrades.
Burr alignment and uniform particles reduce astringency, and blooming helps gas release.
Water chemistry and brew ratio complete the trifecta behind a consistent, sweet cup.
