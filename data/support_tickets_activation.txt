Support tickets highlight confusion at onboarding step 2 and a spike in "code not received" messages.
Many customers tried resending but were unsure whether previous requests invalidated the old code.
Agents also noted a pattern where users changed carriers and never updated the phone number on file.

Ticket volume is 3x normal on weeks when we tweak verification, and response time climbs as agents ask repetitive triage questions.
A saved reply that explains retry windows and alternative channels reduced back-and-forth by 28%.
Adding a link to self-service number updates prevented avoidable escalations in 12% of cases.

Next steps include a diagnostics panel in the app to surface carrier latency and a one-click email fallback.
We should also collect structured fields in the ticket form to quantify which carriers and countries lag most.
These changes would help us close the loop between product experiments and support outcomes.
